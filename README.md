Since World War II, Auburn University (AU) celebrates "Hey Day" 
every year as a way to "unite the Auburn Family and promote a 
friendly atmosphere." On Hey Day, students, faculty, and staff wear 
name tags, and greet one another throughout the day by saying "Hey 
_____!" At Auburn, Hey Day is one of our oldest and more cherished 
traditions. Because we're doing differently this year, here's a 
short script that lets you enjoy Hey Day from wherever you are!
